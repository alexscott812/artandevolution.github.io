                <h3>Steven Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin</h3>
                <p>They argued that human culture has only been around for 10,000 years, which is not long enough for for the brain to have changed substantially from selective pressures. Because of this small time frame, cultural artifacts must be a by-product of our large brains that have evolved to solve other problems.</p>

                <h3>Steven Pinker</h3>
                <p>Music and art originated as pleasurable by-products of mental abilities that evolved for other purposes. He compared art to cheesecake. He suggested that music is like a cheesecake for our ears. “Cheesecake is an artificial by-product designed purely for our pleasure” (Chatterjee 259). He believed art had no adaptive function.</p>

                <h3>Stephen Davies</h3>
                <p>“When I review the theories and the evidence, I am doubtful that the arts, either together or singly, are selected to serve an adaptive function. If I had to bet, I would say that the adaptations that give rise to art behaviors are intelligence, imagination, humor, sociality, emotionality, inventiveness, curiosity” (Davies 185).</p>
